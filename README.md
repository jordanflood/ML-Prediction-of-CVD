# Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)

**By Jordan Flood**

## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, claiming over 17 million lives annually. Despite significant advancements in healthcare, the burden of CVD remains high due to lifestyle factors, aging, and genetic predispositions. In this article, we will explore how data analysis and machine learning can provide actionable insights and build predictive models to improve cardiovascular health.

We will use a dataset containing over 70,000 individual records sourced from Kaggle to identify key factors influencing CVD. Our goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether an individual is at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

## Data Collection & Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, comprising over 70,000 individual records with various attributes like age, BMI, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors.

### Dataset Features
- **Age:** Age of the individual
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index
- **Blood Pressure:** Systolic and diastolic blood pressure
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity

### Data Cleaning
1. Handled missing values by removing rows with NaN values.
2. Normalized numerical data to standardize ranges.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted EDA to identify the relationships between various factors and CVD. Here are some key findings:

### Age
- Increased CVD cases are noticeable between ages 50-55.
- Aging causes heart muscles to thicken and arteries to stiffen, increasing blood pressure.

### BMI
- Higher BMI is associated with a higher risk of CVD.
- Extra strain on the heart due to high BMI leads to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

...

## Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis and subsequent development of a machine-learning model have provided valuable insights into the relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and various factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and lifestyle choices. Our model's ability to predict CVD occurrence with about 72% accuracy underscores the significant potential of machine learning in enhancing our understanding and management of heart health.
